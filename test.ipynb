       "  '\\nThank you all for the kind words and the welcome!\\nAs an only child, and especially after my dad passed when I was 17, Mom and I have always been close, even when it was a very rocky closeness. People have told me how wonderful it is that I\\'m doing the things I am for her--without going into too much detail I\\'ll say this: Every single thing I do, she MORE than deserves. She has gone above and beyond for me throughout my adult life--through some critically bad decisions (divorce, substance abuse, dumb relationships full of drama, financial stupidity galore) as well as some perfectly reasonable decisions she just ferociously disagreed with (my current marriage, buying a house in a neighborhood she didn\\'t approve of)--through all of that, she was still there for me. And as I\\'ve told her--she spent her whole life caring for everyone else. Her siblings, her husband, me, her parents, me again, and again, and again....It\\'s time someone takes care of HER. I wish I could get her to see the nurses as \"assistance\" rather than \"intrusion\". I hate that she\\'s always trying to chase the nurses off, as they all love her and talked about what good company she was before her decline, and once she started improving again--it makes me sad that the unpleasant side of her personality (which, as I can acknowledge from earlier times, definitely exists!) seems to be resurfacing now.While the notion of not answering her calls is tempting, I\\'m fairly certain it would bring on the end of the world.  I exaggerate, of course, but not by much. She is accustomed to having me at her beck and call, which is fine when the conversations are reasonable, but when the whole point of the call is to argue about why she needs nursing care....What I\\'m saying is, that\\'s gonna be a big mountain to climb, but I\\'m sure I\\'ll get there.As far as not trying to explain or reason: That worked PERFECTLY while she was going through the \"anxiety\" phase. Now that SHE believes she\\'s \"normal\"--with, might I add, no recollection whatsoever of the last 4 months!--but now that she believes she\\'s \"normal\" again, she is DEMANDING to be treated as such, and DEMANDING explanations as to why things can\\'t be exactly the way she wants them. (Mom has, all her life, been accustomed to getting her way, and has many, MANY strategies to get there, none of which appear to have deserted her at this time.) It\\'s like if you took an average independent (and extremely stubborn--as I\\'ve told her, I see where I get it!) adult and the only thing you did was to erase their memory going back ...maybe 10 or 20 years. So when she calls and demands to know WHY the nurse is there and WHY she has to be there and so on and so forth....Everything I\\'ve read about dementia totally reinforces the whole \"don\\'t reason or explain, and it\\'s ok to fib, etc\" but ....right now, that\\'s a really hard guide to follow, most especially the fibs. But I think you all might be right, and it might be time to stop answering those calls.I appreciate the guidance and the voices of experience. It\\'s good to know I\\'m not alone.\\n',\n",

This was a big hurdle for me to get over. My DH sundowns like crazy. He used to be very involved in several men's organizations, and will suddenly decide he has to leave for a meeting, right now. Occasionally I can change the subject but more often he won't let it go, demanding to know why he can't get in the car and go to that meeting. Yes, he is looking for answers, but it only made it worse when I tried to reason with him . He has always been an educated and discerning man who was very reasonable. Now, I try to find an answer that will satisfy him. I might tell him the meeting is tomorrow, or canceled because of COVID. Sometimes I get on the phone and call a friend but pretend it's a meeting attendee, confirming the change. I keep it as simple as I can. If I try the real truth ---- he has advanced dementia and certainly could not attend a meeting, much less drive there --- he gets angry and defensive and agitated .

       "  '\\r\\n\\t\\tThank you all again for the welcome--and a special thank you to those of you who had kind words about \"being a good daughter\", because that seems to be my own personal issue right now. Mom has decided that I\\'m \"against\" her. Which I recognize is just dementia being horrible, but....As most of you know, I\\'m sure, the mother-daughter dynamic is often fraught at its best. Nobody can push your buttons like your mom. And ...well, let\\'s just say this \"you have to do exactly what I say or you\\'re the enemy\" thing from Mom is NOT a new development in her personality. We have a long history of butting heads, generally when I wanted to be or do (or date!) something with which she disagreed. But we had gotten past those days--starting about 25 years ago when we both made some MUCH-needed changes to our lives--and our relationship, up til the point when all this started, had vastly improved. And I know the circumstances are different now, but hearing how I\\'m \"not on her side\" and \"working against her\" and all the rest.....it brings stuff back.\\xa0Add to that her little snide comments about \"why aren\\'t YOU here instead of THEM?\" (meaning the nurses) ...things of that nature (and yes, there are good reasons I don\\'t live with Mom, and even if I did move back in I don\\'t think I\\'d be able to keep up with her needs and make sure she\\'s safe--I can work from home, wherever \"home\" is, but I have to WORK--which means I can\\'t watch to make sure Mom\\'s using her walker, or not doing something unsafe, etc.)....but at any rate, the current theme is \"GUILT GUILT GUILT\". (I was raised Catholic--and I mean old-school Catholic, not the modern kind that was taught in my school. Mom and Dad came up on the Baltimore Catechism and they raised me just the same--and one of the main tenets of old-school theology was GUILT. I learned it VERY well.)I\\'m learning how to deal with the 4-7 PM decompensations--I knew about sundowning already, but it\\'s different to have to deal with it. She\\'s threatened to call the police on the nurses; she\\'s threatened to get a lawyer, and to hide the checkbook so I can\\'t pay the bills.\\xa0 The more I deflect, the more she gets angry--so I\\'ve just developed a very basic script that I go over when she starts in on the wheres and whens and whys and whats. I did, however, finally realize: there are times she honestly doesn\\'t know who is in her house or why, or even remember that they\\'ve been there for the last 8 hours. That\\'s got to be terrifying.I do better with being patient/compassionate when she\\'s confused; when she starts out angry at me already, it\\'s a lot harder to respond non-defensively, but I\\'m trying. This is where I have to be very conscious of my own emotional buttons, and recognize that this is NOT 25 years ago, or 30, or 35.But man, it is DIFFICULT sometimes!! The constant implication that I\\'m doing something wrong, or not doing enough, or working against her....And she has a sharp tongue when she\\'s mad, always has.I\\'d never seen or heard the word \"anosognosia\" before now--which is weird, because I am a MAJOR vocabulary nerd. This one\\'s a whole new concept to me, and also it gives me pretzel-brains just trying to think about a disease which makes you unaware that you have a disease. But boy oh boy, do I recognize its effects in my mom! She\\'s convinced she\\'s 100% steady on her feet, her memory is fine, and everything is just peachy, so why would she need any help?\\xa0 She\\'s also demanded that I get the diagnosis in writing from the doctor--because apparently I\\'m making it up, as she sees it, for some benefit of my own--so I talked to her doctor and he\\'s sending me a letter. (I\\'m more interested in having it just in case she DOES call the cops on the nurses--a document from a doctor saying \"this person has dementia and can\\'t safely live alone\" seems like a good thing to have under the circumstances.) She\\'s pretty much decided that she doesn\\'t believe this doctor (or the other two doctors who also tested her, or the brain scan, or....oh look! Anosognosia again!!  ) so I\\'ve told her that if she finds a doctor who tells her she can live alone, I\\'ll go along with it.\\xa0 That seems to slow her roll somewhat, at least sometimes. Some days she just stays mad; I\\'m learning to deal with that, as well.\\xa0I\\'m going to do what I can, for as long as I can. That\\'s the best I can do. But man, I miss my mom. This disease just sucks.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nI think at least one response above was to not refer to them as nurses. That is great advice. PWD usually don\\'t want feel like they need help or that even anything is wrong with them.\\nWith my mom, who lives with us now, we hired an in-home care assistant to help her out during the day while we work (wife goes off to work, I work from home). Before we had the assistant, we were afraid mom would reject any help. What we did was have the lady come over one night for a small birthday party for one of the kids and introduced her as a friend. Which, technically was true, as she was a friend of a friend. Then the next day, when the assistant came over in the morning, I told mom that \\'Jane\\' (that\\'s not her name, but I don\\'t to use real names on here) was over and I was wondering if it was ok if Jane helped mom get dressed, etc. She agreed right away. I was pleasantly shocked! Keep in mind that mom thinks nothing is wrong with herself. I can\\'t even say the D word around her.\\nSince then, mom and Jane have pretty much become great friends. I think mom actually thinks of Jane as more of a \\'butler/maid\\', but she always also says how much she loves Jane, \"when is Jane coming over\", \"is Jane coming over today?\". \"Oh, Jane! How are you doing? So glad to see you!\" It\\'s amazing.\\nNow, maybe we just got a little lucky and/or blessed (I think a bit of both), but I\\'m pretty sure if I told my mom, \"You need someone to take care of you\" she would get angry.\\nMaybe give that a try. Try to somehow make it seem like it\\'s her decision that she has help. I know the situations are different for everyone, but it\\'s worth a try. Maybe in your situation, you can refer to the nurses as mom\\'s staff. Her cook, her phsyical therapist, etc.\\nBest of luck to you.\\n',\n",
